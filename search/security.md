# letter

## hi

I am William Raiford and am contacting you about a possibly novel, hash-based
encryption algorithm you may be interested in.
The full details of the
opportunity can be found at:

https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/HEAD/OPPORTUNITY.md

## tl;dr

I'm looking to give away the patent rights in exchange for
investment in my ibgib project. As you are a security company, I think you would
be most interested in the keystone architecture I have designed that would
subsume current PKI structures, which operate "off-chain" only via the
asymmetric mechanism, with a web3-friendly sigma protocol which would work
"on-chain".

## thanks

If this made it past your spam filter, thanks for your valuable time!
I look forward to speaking with you. To contact me, just reply to this email.

William Raiford

## ps

* I am sending this unsolicited to multiple parties, one by one.
  * That makes me feel better about not calling myself a spammer, but this could be rationalization...
* I am not remotely a quantum expert.
  * I have enjoyed trying to understand the nuances of collapsible hash functions as this relates to my technology ibgib's interest.
  * I am also interested in my fellow humans' opinions about linear algebra as it compares to geometric algebra wrt quantum physics.
* You can find the entire document I used when composing this letter in the encrypt-gib repository
  * https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/HEAD/search/security.md
  * https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibgib/encrypt-gib?activeTab=code
    * You have to navigate to the file manually, for apparent lack of deep linking in npm
* I tell you these notes for a couple reasons:
  * So that you are aware of the security context surrounding this unsolicited email.
  * To show an example of the strange new world opening for us in which secure communications operate in translucency of multi-witness systems.
  * To show the current dearth of existing architecture for this purpose, whereas an open dlt collaboration tool like git for non-src is a tremendous opportunity
    * This is precisely _only one of many_ use cases that ibgib would provide
* vim > emacs
