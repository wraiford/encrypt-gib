## hi

I am William Raiford and am contacting you about my novel, hash-based encryption
algorithm, encrypt-gib, that you may be interested in.
The full details of the opportunity can be found at:

https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/HEAD/OPPORTUNITY.md

## tl;dr

I'm looking to give away the patent rights in exchange for investment in my
ibgib project. As you are a security company, I think you would be most
interested in the keystone architecture I have designed that would subsume
current PKI structures, which operate "off-chain" only via the asymmetric
mechanism, with a web3-friendly sigma protocol which would work "on-chain".  I
think that you would be interested for similar reasons to NIST's recent decision
to accept SPHINCS+ for digital signatures. They were accepted for a
diversification of methods, despite being "less efficient" WRT data signature
size. Note that encrypt-gib, however, is indeed for **encryption** and not
signatures. If that is surprising, that may be signal for you at least
justifying further investigation. The approach is not entirely unheard of, as
you can refer to patent number u.s. pat. no.  5,483,598, kaufman and perlman,
"message encryption using a hash function". Though encrypt-gib has key
differences, as its purpose is for my vision of the future of web3.

## thanks

If this made it past your spam filter, thanks for your valuable time! I look
forward to speaking with you. To contact me, just reply to this email, or you
are welcome to communicate on GitHub issues (though note that their issues are
not part of git's Merkle DAG, and thus would lock us in to their platform).

William Raiford

## ps

* I am sending this unsolicited to multiple parties, one by one.
  * That makes me feel better about not calling myself a spammer, but this could
    be rationalization...
* I am not remotely a quantum mechanics expert.
  * I am extremely interested in how quantum effects pertain to ibgib's DLT.
    * e.g. I have enjoyed trying to understand the nuances of collapsible hash
      functions as this relates to my technology ibgib's interest.
  * I am also interested in my quantum experts' opinions about linear algebra as
    it compares to geometric algebra.
* You can find the entire document I used when composing this letter in the
  encrypt-gib repository
  * https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/HEAD/search/security.md
  * https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibgib/encrypt-gib?activeTab=code
    * You have to navigate to the file manually, for apparent lack of deep linking in npm.
* I tell you these notes for a couple reasons:
  * So that you are aware of the security context surrounding this unsolicited
    email.
  * To show an example of the strange new world opening for us in which secure
    communications operate in translucency of multi-witness systems.
  * To show the current dearth of existing architecture for this purpose,
    whereas an open dlt collaboration tool like git for non-src is a tremendous
    opportunity.
    * This is precisely _only one of many_ use cases that ibgib would provide
* vim > emacs
